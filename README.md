## Crowdfunding Analysis Challenge

## Overview

This project involves a detailed analysis of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to uncover market trends and determine factors that contribute to the success or failure of crowdfunding campaigns. This analysis utilizes advanced Excel features such as conditional formatting, pivot tables, and complex formulas to dissect the dataset and provide actionable insights.

## Repository Structure

## Files

## Instructions
## Data Preparation
1- Conditional Formatting: Apply different colors to the outcome column to reflect the status of campaigns (successful, failed, canceled, live).
2- New Calculated Columns:
- Percent Funded: Calculate how much money a campaign made compared to its goal.
- Average Donation: Determine the average donation amount per backer.
- Parent Category and Sub-Category: Split the combined category column into two distinct columns.
## Data Analysis
1- Pivot Tables and Charts:
- Create pivot tables and corresponding charts to analyze success rates by category and sub-category.
- Implement pivot tables to analyze outcomes based on the launch date.
2- Crowdfunding Goal Analysis:
- Use COUNTIFS() to analyze the success, failure, and cancellation rates by different goal ranges.
- Visualize the relationship between goal amounts and outcomes with a line chart.
## Statistical Analysis
- Summary Statistics Table: Analyze the number of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns to identify trends and variances.
